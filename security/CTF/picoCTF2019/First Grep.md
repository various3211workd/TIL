# First Grep

## 問題
> Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way. You can also find the file in /problems/first-grep_1_6788154ca7ee937f569985ff397203b6 on the shell server.

## 解答

```shell
$ cat file | grep 'pico'
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_205b65d7}
```
